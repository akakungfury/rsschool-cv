## About:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've finished BSUIR for radioelectronics-engineer specialization. I had worked as design engineer for two years after university. At the moment I'm QA automation engineer.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had learned JS for some hours per week for two or three months before I found QA automation vacancy. I had completed test task and got this job without any knowledge and experience in manual testing, but of course I tried to learn all necessary things as soon as possible after I started to work. My main working tool is Cypress. This is a testing framework which uses JavaScript as a scripting language. My general work tasks are UI and API testing.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to try my self in development. I want to become a good specialist to be able to work on interesting projects and create something really cool. I'm a responsible worker and I always strive to understand well of the tools and technologies which I use. I always like to create, to search solution and to learn something new especially if that can help with me job or improve my skills.
