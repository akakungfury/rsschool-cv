        <h3>profile</h3>
        <p>
          I've finished BSUIR for radioelectronics-engineer specialization. I
          had worked as design engineer for two years after university. At the
          moment I'm QA automation engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had learned JS for some hours per week for two or three months
          before I found QA automation vacancy. I had completed test task and
          got this job without any knowledge and experience in manual testing,
          but of course I tried to learn all necessary things as soon as
          possible after I started to work. My main working tool is Cypress.
          This is a testing framework which uses JavaScript as a scripting
          language. My general work tasks are UI and API testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to try my self in development. I want to become a good
          specialist to be able to work on interesting projects and create
          something really cool. I'm a responsible worker and I always strive to
          understand well of the tools and technologies which I use. I always
          like to create, to search solution and to learn something new
          especially if that can help with my job or improve my skills.
